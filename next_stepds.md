Great question! For this system to work with Gmail API, you need a **Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) email account**, not a regular @gmail.com account. Here are your options:

---

## **Option 1: Use Google Workspace (Recommended for Production)**

**What you need:**
- A domain you own (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
- Google Workspace subscription (~$6/month per user)

**Steps:**
1. Go to [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com)
2. Sign up with your domain
3. Create a user like `assignments@yourdomain.com`
4. This gives you full Gmail API access + domain-wide delegation

**Pros:**
- ✅ Full Gmail API support
- ✅ Domain-wide delegation works
- ✅ Professional email
- ✅ Proper for production

**Cons:**
- ❌ Costs money (~$6-12/month)
- ❌ Requires owning a domain

---

## **Option 2: Use Regular Gmail (Testing Only - Limited)**

**For quick testing**, you can use a regular Gmail account, but with **significant limitations**:

1. Create a new Gmail account at [gmail.com](https://accounts.google.com/signup)
2. Use OAuth instead of domain-wide delegation
3. **Cannot** use domain-wide delegation (which your architecture requires)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Free
- ✅ Quick to set up

**Cons:**
- ❌ No domain-wide delegation
- ❌ More complex OAuth flow
- ❌ Not suitable for production
- ❌ Can't impersonate service accounts

## **Option 3: Google Workspace Trial (Best for Now)**

**My recommendation:**

1. **Sign up for Google Workspace 14-day free trial:**
   - Go to https://workspace.google.com
   - Click "Get Started"
   - Use a domain you own OR use a temporary one

2. **Don't have a domain?** You can:
   - Buy one cheap from Google Domains ($12/year)
   - Use a free subdomain from services like Freenom (not recommended for production)
   - Use a domain you already own

3. **Create the assignments email:**
   - Once Workspace is set up, create user: `assignments@yourdomain.com`
   - This becomes your Gmail API mailbox

## **My Recommendation for You:**

Since you're a PM building this as a prototype, I'd suggest:

### **Path A: If you have a domain already**
1. Sign up for Google Workspace trial (14 days free)
2. Create `assignments@yourdomain.com`
3. Complete the Gmail integration
4. Decide later if you want to keep paying or find alternatives

### **Path B: If you don't have a domain**
1. Buy a cheap domain ($12/year)
2. Sign up for Google Workspace trial
3. Create `assignments@yourdomain.com`
4. You have 14 days to test everything

### **Path C: Quick hack for testing**
Use a regular Gmail account temporarily, but know you'll need to refactor to OAuth and can't use domain-wide delegation.

## **What's Your Situation?**

1. **Do you have a domain name?** (e.g., yourdomain.com)
2. **Are you willing to pay for Google Workspace?** (~$6/month)
3. **Or do you want me to show you how to set this up with a regular Gmail for testing?** (with caveats)
